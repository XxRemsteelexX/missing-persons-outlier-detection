## Detailed State Breakdown

### TIER 1: Best Historical Data (20+ years)

#### Texas - WINNER FOR DEPTH
- **Database:** DPS Missing Persons Clearinghouse (MPCH)
- **Established:** 1986
- **Coverage:** 39 years (1986-2025)
- **Additional:** DNA Database added 2001, Unidentified Persons Unit 2007
- **Access:** Online bulletin searchable
- **Data Quality:** Central repository for all of Texas since 1986

#### California - RUNNER-UP
- **Database:** DOJ Missing Persons System
- **Public Statistics:** 1996-2025 (29 years)
- **Law Enforcement Database:** Likely older (exact date unknown)
- **Legal Requirement:** Agencies required to report to state system
- **Access:** Public search available, statistics published annually
- **Data Quality:** Mandatory reporting = good coverage

#### Michigan - OLDEST INDIVIDUAL CASES
- **Database:** MSP Missing Persons
- **Oldest Case:** 1958 (67 years ago!)
- **Notes:** Has 12 people missing since before 1970
- **Coverage:** Spotty for old cases, better for modern
- **Data Quality:** Cold cases entered retroactively

---

### TIER 2: Moderate Historical Data (10-20 years)

#### Florida
- **Database:** FDLE Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse (MEPIC)
- **Access:** Public Access System (PAS), updated daily
- **Historical Range:** **UNKNOWN** - not disclosed publicly
- **Contact:** MEPIC@fdle.state.fl.us, (850)410-8585
- **Notes:** Would need to contact directly to determine historical depth

#### Washington
- **Database:** WASPC (coordinated by sheriffs/police chiefs)
- **Established:** Mid-2000s
- **Coverage:** **~15-20 years**, but with major caveat
- **WARNING:** Cases >5 years old may be inadvertently removed
- **2020 Change:** Removed requirement to enter cases into NamUs
- **Data Quality:** Inconsistent, county-dependent
- **Historical Cases:** Some counties have 1990s cases (Snohomish, Whatcom)

---

### TIER 3: Limited/No State Database

#### Illinois - NO OFFICIAL STATE DATABASE
- **Official Database:** **NONE**
- **Volunteer Database:** IllinoisMissing.org (2017-2025, 8 years)
- **NamUs Requirement:** Should report within 45 days, but not followed
- **Cook County:** Maintains own archive for 3+ year cases
- **Data Quality:** POOR - no centralized tracking
- **Historical:** Would need county-by-county research

#### Ohio
- **Database:** AG Missing Persons Unit
- **Access:** ohioattorneygeneral.gov/missingpersons
- **Historical Range:** **UNKNOWN**
- **Notes:** Modern database, unclear how far back

#### Pennsylvania
- **Database:** PA Emergency Response Center
- **Historical Range:** **UNKNOWN**
- **Notes:** No public info on data depth

## National Resources (All States)

### NamUs (National Missing & Unidentified Persons System)
- **Established:** 2007 (Unidentified), 2008 (Missing)
- **Coverage:** 2007-2025 (18 years)
- **Oldest Cases:** Some backfill to 1975, but sparse
- **Access:** Free registration required
- **Export:** CSV, 10K case limit per batch
- **Coverage:** Not all states participate equally
- **Data Quality:** Voluntary, inconsistent

### Doe Network (Volunteer)
- **Coverage:** Historical cases back to 1950s-1960s
- **Data Quality:** Volunteer-maintained, incomplete
- **Access:** Free, publicly searchable
- **Notes:** Good for cold cases, not comprehensive

---

## Missing Persons Trend Data (National)

| Year | Missing Persons Reported |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1997 | ~1,000,000 (peak) |
| 2007 | ~850,000 |
| 2017 | 650,000 |
| 2023 | 563,389 |

**Trend:** Steady decline since 1997 (better tracking, Amber alerts, cell phones)

## Recommendations for FBI Project

### Strategy 1: Focus on Texas (Best Single-State Data)
**Why:**
- 39 years of data (1986-2025)
- Central repository (mandatory reporting)
- Large state (diverse geography: rural, city, metro)
- Known serial killers for validation (none in timeframe, but good for methodology)

**Pros:**
- Deep historical data
- Single API/source
- Good population diversity

**Cons:**
- Only one state (FBI wants national view)
- No major serial killers 1986+ for validation

---

### Strategy 2: Multi-State Approach (TX, CA, MI)
**Why:**
- Texas: 1986+
- California: 1996+
- Michigan: Oldest cold cases

**Pros:**
- Geographic diversity (South, West, Midwest)
- Combined population: ~80M (25% of US)
- Can show methodology scales across states

**Cons:**
- 3 different data formats
- California only goes back to 1996
- More complex data integration

---

### Strategy 3: NamUs National (2007-2025)
**Why:**
- All 50 states
- Standardized format
- Already researched access method

**Pros:**
- National scope (FBI will like this)
- Standardized data
- Can export via CSV

**Cons:**
- Only 18 years (2007-2025)
- Cannot validate against 1970s-1980s serial killers
- Voluntary reporting = incomplete

---

## Recommended Approach: HYBRID

### Primary Analysis: NamUs National (2007-2025)
- Show national patterns
- All 50 states
- Standardized methodology

### Deep Dive Case Study: Texas (1986-2025)
- Show what's possible with deeper historical data
- 39 years of trends
- Validate methodology on longer timeline

### Validation: Michigan Cold Cases (1950s-2020s)
- Use oldest cases to show pattern detection works
- Demonstrate cold case prioritization

### Acknowledge Limitation:
"This analysis demonstrates the methodology using available data (2007-2025 nationally, 1986-2025 for Texas). With FBI database access (NCIC, ViCAP), this system could analyze complete historical data back to 1960s and validate against all known serial crime cases."

## Action Items

### Immediate:
1. **Register for NamUs** (national data, 2007-2025)
2. **Contact Texas DPS** (request MPCH data access, 1986-2025)
3. **Contact California DOJ** (request statistics/data, 1996-2025)

### While Waiting for Approvals:
1. **Download Doe Network data** (cold cases, all states)
2. **Get Census population data** (1980-2025)
3. **Build outlier detection code**
4. **Build radial search tool**

### Data Collection Priority:
1. **NamUs** (broadest coverage, standardized)
2. **Texas** (deepest historical single-state)
3. **California** (second deepest, large population)
4. **Doe Network** (supplement for very old cases)

## Key Insight from Research

**What we're discovering:**
- Most states don't have good historical data before 2000
- NamUs (2007+) is best national source
- Texas (1986+) is the gold mine for state-level depth
- Pre-1990 data is scattered, incomplete, county-dependent

**Implication:**
We **cannot** do a full national analysis back to 1970s-1980s with public data. But we **can** show:
1. National patterns 2007-2025 (NamUs)
2. Texas deep-dive 1986-2025 (shows methodology scales)
3. Validation on available cases (Ridgway, modern cases)

**For FBI Application:**
"This demonstrates proof-of-concept with public data. With access to FBI databases (NCIC missing persons files dating to 1975, ViCAP crime pattern analysis), this methodology could be extended to complete historical analysis and validated against all known serial crime cases from 1960-2025."

## Next Steps

1. ✅ We now know data availability by state
2. ⏳ Register for NamUs (national, 2007-2025)
3. ⏳ Contact Texas DPS for MPCH access (1986-2025)
4. ⏳ Get Census API key
5. ⏳ Start building code while waiting for data access

**Status:** Data research complete. Ready to start implementation.

**Timeline:** 3-4 days for NamUs national analysis + Texas deep-dive case study.
